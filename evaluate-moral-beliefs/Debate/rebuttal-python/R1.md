**Weakness 1:** “How robust is Ernie Bot to regenerate ChatGPT’s 514 moral scenarios? And does the bias from the model interfere with the generated scenarios? How do the authors mitigate this?”

**Response:** 
With the help of ChatGPT, we successfully generated 514 moral scenarios, with only a few Chinese idioms not being accurately understood by it. To more precisely grasp the connotations of these Chinese idioms, we introduced the Chinese language model Ernie Bot, which exhibited remarkable robustness and could assist us in generating moral scenarios closely related to these idioms. Since the number of idioms involved was relatively small, minor deviations in the model had little interference on the generated scenarios. Additionally, we set up prompts to guide the model in explaining moral terms first, ensuring that it generates moral scenarios that are in line with the modified terms based on a thorough understanding. This measure effectively reduced the differences between different models in generating moral scenarios, enhancing overall consistency and accuracy.

**Weakness 2:** “The authors mentioned that “The temperature settings for the four models are 0.95, 0.95, 0.9, and 0.9”, is there any specific reason in using different temperature settings for each model used? And will the results change if we change the temperature?”

**Response:** 
The temperature parameter indeed plays a crucial role in shaping the diversity and certainty of the text generated by the models. At lower temperature settings, models are more inclined to select words with higher probabilities, yielding outputs that are more predictable and consistent. On the other hand, higher temperature settings introduce greater randomness into the generation process, which can lead to a wider variety of outputs, albeit with potential inconsistencies.
To address the question of how results may vary with different temperature settings for the models, we have conducted extensive experiments to examine the consistency rate of the models' outputs during the moral choice phase across a range of temperature settings: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. The detailed findings from these experiments are as follows：

Table 2: Consistency rates of the firmness scores given by different models in the moral choice module under various temperature settings. 

Table 1 reveals that the consistency rates for models selecting options in the moral choice module are consistently above 0.79, irrespective of the temperature settings. Notably, both Ernie and ChatGPT exhibit consistency rates exceeding 0.9, demonstrating a high degree of consistency. This suggests that the influence of temperature on option selection is not substantially significant. Table 2, on the other hand, illustrates the consistency rates for the firmness scores assigned by the models (ranging from 1 to 3) at various temperature settings. Here, all four models maintain consistency rates above 0.66, which, while lower than the option selection rates, indicates a discernible effect of temperature on the models' firmness scoring. We concur that elevated temperature settings can amplify the diversity and stochastic nature of the models' text generation, potentially yielding more dynamic and adaptable responses in debate scenarios. We posit that incorporating such diversity at higher temperatures more accurately mirrors the intricacy and unpredictability individuals encounter when navigating moral quandaries in real-world discussions. Regarding the specific temperature values, we have adhered to the default settings recommended for each model, as outlined in their respective official documentation or default web configurations. In the case of the GPT-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI, the official documentation suggests a default temperature of 0, which we have adjusted to 0.9 to reflect a more nuanced and engaging debate environment.

**Weakness 3:** “Credits for the authors to be aware that the models can be susceptible to prompt variations and made a consistency comparisons on the models, but they did not mention how they mitigate the inconsistency.”

**Response:**
The consistency outcomes presented in Table 2 are crucial for further investigation, as they shed light on various issues, such as the substantial impact of prompt design on LLMs' capabilities and the relatively high consistency exhibited by ChatGPT and Gemini, indicating a close alignment of their moral beliefs across both scenario and word levels. Moreover, incorporating different genders in moral scenarios can influence the models' choices.  
To bolster the consistency of models in executing moral choice tasks, we have employed a set of fundamental measures. Before conducting the formal experiments, we refined the prompts provided to the models using a variety of prompt engineering techniques aimed at strengthening their consistency and dependability. In the moral choice and moral debate stages, we crafted meticulous prompt scripts, set format guidelines for the output, and offered illustrative examples to direct the models on crafting appropriate responses. We recognize that enhancing model consistency is a continuous endeavor, and we remain committed to discovering additional techniques to improve the models' steadiness when confronted with diverse prompts. In our forthcoming research, we intend to incorporate an expanded array of prompt design tactics and execute more comprehensive consistency assessments, ensuring that our models are capable of delivering reliable and consistent moral evaluations across a spectrum of conditions.

**Weakness 4:** “While it is novel to use a firmness score to evaluate the LLMs, the authors did not test the firmness consistency of the models tested, so it is not clear whether the models are consistently “firm” about the option they chose. In addition, the consistency test of the firmness of the model will benefit this study to further tell that Gemini is consistently the most confident model in their judgment.”

**Response:**
In addressing the concern you've raised about the consistency of firmness scores, we have carried out a straightforward experiment, as delineated in Table 3. This involved three iterative rounds of questioning to gauge the proportion of instances where the models' selections and assigned firmness scores for moral choices remained invariant. This assessment was devised to test the stability of the outcomes provided by the models.

|                | ChatGLM | Ernie | Gemini | ChatGPT |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
|     Option     |  0.56   | 0.98  |  0.89  |  0.89   |
| Firmness Score |  0.66   | 0.96  |  0.67  |  0.55   |

Table 3：The proportion of instances where the models' choices of options for moral choice and the assigned firmness scores were completely consistent across three rounds of repeated questioning.

The outcomes indicated that the Ernie model demonstrated the highest degree of output stability, with Gemini following closely behind. Nevertheless, we posit that relying solely on the frequency of consistent responses across multiple questioning sessions may fall short, particularly given the intricacies and diversities of scenarios encountered in actual societal scenarios. In this research, we introduced firmness scores to capture and appraise the models' self-assurance regarding their moral choices. This novel methodology transcends traditional repetitive questioning by aiming to offer a more profound insight into the models' moral decision-making processes. 
Although our present study has not yet thoroughly investigated the consistency of firmness scores through methods such as repeated questioning, we refer to scholarly works like "Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate" and "Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers", which imply that the models' firmness has been preliminarily tested and exhibited through the moral debate segments introduced. In these debates, models not only articulated justifications for their selections but also countered opposing viewpoints, thereby showcasing, to an extent, the models' commitment or adaptability in their moral convictions.

**Weakness 5:** “In the line 554-559 the authors discussed the portion of changes before and after the debate. The authors said that the models are “almost never deviated” and “more likely change its initial choice”. There should be a proper quantification on how much the model deviate from its original answer before and after the debate.”

**Response:**  
“Almost never deviated”: 98%.  
“More likely change its initial choice”: 0%.  
The specific data can be found in Table 5 of the paper.

**Weakness 6:** “Need a comprehensive description/flowchart on how the Best-Worst Scaling and Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking are done in the evaluation stage.”

**Response:**
Here is a detailed description of the specific steps we took to use Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) and Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking (ICLR) for the evaluation stage.   
Initially, following the BWS method, we constructed pairs of options with associated scores. BWS typically involves dividing into several groups and asking evaluators to make preference choices to identify the best and worst items, which are then used to construct pairs of options. In this paper, we determined the models' preferences for moral principles through their chosen options to obtain the corresponding pairs of options.   
In the dataset of this paper, each scenario contains two options, each corresponding to 1-2 moral principles, so during the construction of pairs of options, after the model selects an option, we can obtain 1-4 pairs of options. After obtaining the pairs of options, refer to the ICLR method for scoring pairs of options. In our experiment, the score for the pairs of options is based on the frequency of occurrence. It is important to note that there will inevitably be contradictory pairs of options in the overall dataset, such as a scenario where the model chooses option A, corresponding to the pair: x > y, while in another scenario, there may be a pair: y > x. In such cases, we calculate the frequency of their occurrence in the entire dataset, retaining the pairs of options with higher frequency, and the score for that pair is the original frequency minus the frequency of the contradictory pair. In this way, we obtain the pairs of options and their corresponding scores. Subsequently, we directly use ICLR to obtain the overall ranking and corresponding weights based on the pairs of options.

**Comment 1:** ““human data collection involved annotators exclusively from China, omitting those with an English cultural background” Is there any technique/rules to hire and manage these annotators?”

**Response:**
In this study, we randomly selected 30 college students from a university, with half male and half female, to balance the gender ratio as much as possible. We provided detailed training for the annotators and frankly informed them of the purpose and processing methods of the data, while strictly protecting their personal information to ensure that they can participate in the project with ease and confidence. In addition, in order to motivate the annotators, we provided reasonable compensation. At the same time, we implemented strict quality control mechanisms by setting quality control questions and excluding invalid questionnaires, thereby further improving the quality of the data and the accuracy of the research.

**Comment 2:** “To convert these small pairs of rankings into real-valued scores, we employed Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) (Louviere et al., 2015) and Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking (Maystre and Grossglauser, 2015). → there should be examples with scores.”

**Comment 3:** “The authors said that they adopt Khan et al., 2024's method, but did not mention how they implemented it, and the examples in the appendix are templates that will be used to the four models. I suggest adding more comprehensive examples of the real model interactions in the appendix.”

**Response:**
The study by Khan et al. (2024) aims to bolster the capacity of weaker models to assess stronger ones through structured debate. In this process, two expert models, referred to as debaters, present opposing answers to a given question. This debate unfolds over a set number of rounds, denoted as N, during which the arguments of the debaters are meticulously recorded. Each round sees debaters building upon previous arguments and crafting new ones for the subsequent round. Once the designated rounds are completed, judges review the transcripts and endeavor to select the correct answer. Here, each debater endeavors to sway the judge in favor of their viewpoint, while the judge's role is to discern the correct answer amidst the conflicting claims. The competitive nature of this approach lies in the strategic presentation of arguments by the debaters, each seeking to undermine the credibility of their opponent's assertions. At the outset of each round, debaters receive similar prompts outlining the nature of the debate, the designated answer, and the current scoring.    
Our debate process seeks to gauge the stability of models when confronted with moral scenarios. Instead of assigning a judging role, we engage only two models - Model A, under evaluation, and Model B, the opposing debater. Model A receives prompts on moral scenarios and questions, initially free to select its response, while Model B is tasked with countering A's response from an alternate standpoint. Throughout the rounds, debaters build upon prior arguments while generating new ones. A and B take turns responding, and after N rounds, Model A makes choice again.   
Below is an example illustrating the interaction between the ChatGLM and Gemini models concerning a moral scenario revolving around ‘lying’.
